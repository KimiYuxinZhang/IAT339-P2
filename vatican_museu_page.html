            <p>The Vatican Museum is a blend of art and history. The palace is the result of 500 years of additions and expansion, which created the centuries-old splendor that visitors see today.</p>

                <h3>Sistine Chapel</h3>
                <p>The Vatican's Sistine Chapel is probably the most well-known single room in the world, mostly because of the awe-inspiring frescoes by that titan of the Renaissance, Michelangelo Buonarroti. The Sistine Chapel is still used for masses and, more famously, papal conclaves.

                <h3>Borgia Apartment</h3>
                <p>The Borgia Apartments in the Vatican Museums are a series of rooms commissioned by Pope Alexander VI. The rooms include the Hall of the Mysteries of Faith, the Hall of the Sibyls, and the Hall of the Saints, each with intricate ceiling frescoes and wall paintings that illustrate sacred stories and figures. </p>
